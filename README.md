# Java-Array_Sorting_Prime_Elements
This Java program sorts only the prime numbers in an array while keeping the non-prime elements unchanged. It first extracts prime numbers, sorts them, and reinserts them into their original positions. The implementation includes an isPrime() method to check for prime numbers and uses nested loops for sorting.
